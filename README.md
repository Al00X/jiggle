## How to use my arrived switch?

Well... you can use it however you want, but if you are genuinely asking that question...
ok! Lucky you, I got some instructions for you.

```tsx
import { JiggleSwitch } from '@al00x/jiggle-switch';

<JiggleSwitch type={...} value={...} onValue={...} />
```
There are some types, you can check them out in the demo or the [config file](packages/jiggle-switch/src/configs.ts).

Also, you can tune your switch to your own needs, some like it wild, some soft... or wiggly... or.. . . . . . _ehm_, nvm.

Tuning switches would override their default factory settings;

\* \* **I have no responsibilities if you tuned a switch to it's maximum, and it got drained out.** \* \*

| Param | Description                                                      |
| :--- |:-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `aggro` | how hardcore it shakes. _[the elastic offset of the handle]_     |
| `temperature` | the more hot, the more jiggly! _[self-explanatory]_              |
| `eros` | the more eros, the more force. _[multiplier to rotation degree]_ |
| `mass` | the more mass, the more drag! _[some jelly smearing]_            |

There are also some other hidden features and holes which are documented in the [Switch](/packages/jiggle-switch/src/JiggleSwitch.tsx) itself.
